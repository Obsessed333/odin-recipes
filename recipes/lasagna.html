    <h2>This is the recipe for the lasagna</h4> 
    <p>For this recipe, we are essentially making a thick, meaty tomato sauce and layering that with noodles and cheese into a casserole. Here's the run-down:</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 teaspoons extra virgin olive oil</li>
           <li>1 pound ground beef chuck</li> 
           <li> 1/2 medium onion, diced (about 3/4 cup)</li>
           <li>1/2 large bell pepper (green, red, or yellow), diced (about 3/4 cup)</li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li> 
            <li>1 (28-ounce)can good-quality tomato sauce</li>
            <li>3 ounces tomato paste (half a 6-ounce can)</li>
           <li>1 (14 ounce) can crushed tomatoes</li> 
            <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh oregano, or 2 teaspoons dried oregano</li>
            <li>1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley (preferably flat leaf), packed</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon Italian seasoning</li>
            <li>1 pinch garlic powder and/or garlic salt</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon red or white wine vinegar</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon to 1/4 cup sugar (to taste, optional)</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
            <li>1/2 pound dry lasagna noodles (requires 9 lasagna noodles - unbroken)</li>
            <li>15 ounces ricotta cheese</li>
            <li>1 1/2 pounds (24 ounces) mozzarella cheese, grated or sliced</li>
           <li> 1/4 pound (4 ounces) freshly grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Steps to follow
    </h2>
           <ol>

<li><strong>Start by making the sauce</strong> with ground beef, bell peppers, onions, and a combo of tomato sauce, tomato paste, and crushed tomatoes. The three kinds of tomatoes gives the sauce great depth of flavor.</li>
<li><strong>Let this simmer while you boil the noodles and get the cheeses ready.</strong> We're using ricotta, shredded mozzarella, and parmesan -- like the mix of tomatoes, this 3-cheese blend gives the lasagna great flavor!</li>
<li><strong>From there, it's just an assembly job.</strong> A cup of meat sauce, a layer of noodles, more sauce, followed by a layer of cheese. Repeat until you have three layers and have used up all the ingredients</li>
<li><strong>Bake until bubbly and you're ready to eat!</strong></li>
