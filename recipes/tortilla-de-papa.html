    <h1>Recipe for a Delicious Tortilla</h1>

    <h2>This is the recipe for the Tortilla</h2> 
    <p>Is there anything more Spanish than la tortilla espa√±ola? Also called tortilla de patatas, Spanish omelette, Spanish tortilla, potato omelet, and even Spanish frittata, this is arguably Spain's national dish. Most Spanish families I know make it at least once a week, and my mother-in-law makes this when she needs a quick and easy meal.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Waxy Potatoes</li>
           <li>Oil</li> 
           <li>Eggs</li>
           <li>Onion</li>
            <li>Salt</li> 
           </ul>
            
    <h2>Steps to follow
    </h2>
           <ol>

<li><strong>Peel and rinse the potatoes.</strong> Be sure to choose a waxy variety, as they won't break down as much during the cooking process.</li>
<li><strong>Thinly slice them</strong> using a sharp knife or mandoline.</li>
<li><strong>Pat the sliced potatoes dry </strong> with paper towel to remove excess moisture. This will help them crisp when they're fried.</li>
<li><strong>Sprinkle the slices with salt</strong> to add flavor.</li>
<li><strong>Add the sliced potatoes to hot olive oil</strong>, making sure the potatoes are fully covered with oil. (Don't worry, you can reuse the oil a few times, so it won't go to waste.) Cook over a medium heat for 20 minutes, being careful not to let them brown too much.</li>
<li>While the potatoes are cooking, <strong>beat the room-temperature eggs</strong> in a large bowl until well combined.</li>
<li><strong>Add the salt.</strong> Many people taste the raw egg mixture to adjust the salt level, but if you prefer not to, add a couple of teaspoons for now.</li>
<li><strong>Thinly slice the onions.</strong> This will give the tortilla the right texture and help the onions cook more quickly and evenly.
</li>
<li>When the potatoes are fully cooked, some may start to break apart. That's okay, but don't let them become too broken down.</li>
<li>Once the potatoes have cooked for 20 minutes, use a skimmer or spider to remove them from the hot oil.</li>
<li><strong>Place the cooked potatoes in a colander</strong> to allow them to cool and drain, about 5 minutes.</li>
<li>Add the sliced onions to a separate pan with a bit of olive oil.<strong> Cook over a medium heat until they start to caramelize,</strong>about 15-20 minutes. Add a splash of water if needed from time to time so that they don't burn.</li>
<li><strong>Gently stir the onions</strong> into the egg mixture.</li>
<li>Carefully<strong> add the potatoes </strong>into the onion and egg mixture, stirring gently to keep them from scrambling the egg.</li>
<li><strong>Let the mixture sit for 15 minutes. </strong> I know it's tempting to just go ahead and make the tortilla, but trust me on this!</li>
<li>Gently pour the tortilla batter into a frying pan over medium-low heat. You don't want the pan to be too hot. <strong>Gently cook the tortilla for about 6-8 minutes on the first side. </strong>You can run a spatula occasionally along the sides to make sure it's not sticking. </li>
<li>To flip the tortilla, grab a plate that's larger than the frying pan. (See my note below about the two tortilla trick to make this easier.) Put the plate on top of the pan and flip quickly and confidently. It will be runny, but don't worry -- you'll put everything back into the pan to cook the other side!</li>
<li>Slide the tortilla back into the frying pan and let the other side cook for another six to eight minutes (let it cook longer if you like your tortilla fully cooked through). Then flip back out onto a clean plate. Allow it to cool for at least ten minutes before slicing and enjoying. </li>
