        <li>4 ripe bananas, cut into chunks</li>
           <li>3-4 tbsp milk</li> 
           <li>2 tbsp toasted flaked almonds</li>

<li>Pop the banana chunks on a flat tray and cover well. Freeze for at least 1 hr, or until frozen through. When ready to eat throw the banana into a food processor and whizz until smooth with enough of the milk to achieve a creamy texture. Scoop into 4 bowls or glasses, then top with the sauce and nuts.</li>
